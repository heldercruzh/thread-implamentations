/*
Java thread pool: manages the pool of worker threads. It contains a queue that keeps tasks waiting to get executed.

In program, we are creating a fixed-size thread pool of 5 worker threads. 
Then we are submitting 10 jobs to this pool, since the pool size is 5, it will start working on 5 jobs 
and other jobs will be in wait state, as soon as one of the job is finished, another job from the wait 
queue will be picked up by worker thread and getâ€™s executed.
